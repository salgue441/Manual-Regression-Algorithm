## Projects

### Linear Regression

#### Data Source

The "Large-scale Wave Energy Farm" dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, forms the foundation of this analysis. Created by researchers from the University of Adelaide and Monash University, this dataset was contributed to UCI on September 16, 2023. It comprises 63,600 instances, each representing unique configurations of wave energy converters in a wave farm.

#### How to Run

To execute the analysis, run the following command:

```bash
cd regression/src
python main.py
```

or in the codespace configured in this repository.

### Neural Network

### Documentation

The analysis of both projects can be found in the `docs` directory.
